# traversy-media-js
Everything in the repo is the result of each challenge provided by Traversy Media JavaScript Program.


All my practice code in in the sandbox folder. I added this about 25% into the program to better account for commits on Github. This folder will be messy.

All challenges will have their own folders. If you are interested in seeing the full context of any challenge, please reach out to me at ambition_aidev@gmail.com
